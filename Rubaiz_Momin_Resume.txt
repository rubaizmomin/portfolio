• Authored 73 new GUI test cases in Ranorex and improved the reliability of complex gestures like drag and drop, resizing images, leading to improving overall test coverage by 4%.

PROJECTS

Delta
ASP.Net Core Blazor Webassembly, ASP.Net Core Web API, SSMS, Entity Framework
• Created an internal testing configuration tool for Kinaxis that lets developers personalise targets from 250,000+ daily tests, surfacing results in seconds.
• Implemented local storage customisation so developers could store unique configurations and filter test results based on relevance.
• Optimised database queries using Entity Framework + SQL Server, enabling efficient lookups across millions of test records spanning 25+ test types.

Verboverse
MERN, WebRTC, Google Translation API, Three-Tier Architecture
• Led a 3-member team to develop a video/audio translation platform that supports 50+ languages for real-time cross-language communication.
• Designed backend peer connections using WebRTC + MongoDB, supporting lengthy meetings, text channels and live translation delivery.
• Built and deployed a RESTful API for P2P connections, chat persistence, and email notifications, improving reliability and user experience.

Github Actions Pipeline Dashboard
ReactJS, ExpressJS, NodeJS, Github API
• Developed a centralised dashboard for 520+ employees to monitor workflow statuses across multiple repositories, eliminating the need to check GitHub manually.
• Enhanced UX with real-time updates (status, duration, last run) and integrated workflow redirects for faster debugging.
• Generalised and documented the codebase, enabling other teams to adapt the dashboard to their own CI/CD needs.

Routing Algorithm Simulation
Mininet, Python, NetworkX
• Created a routing simulation to compare Forward Search Algorithm (Dijkstra) and Distance Vector Algorithm (Bellman Ford) on metrics like algorithm runtime, stabilisation time on link failures varying across different types of topologies.
• Developed the link failure and recovery feature which runs parallel to the simulation, seeing real-time behaviour of the network due to random link failures/recovery to study network stabilisation.
• Parsed miniedit graph to translate to an adjacency list to run algorithms and parsed adjacency list back to miniEdit to change link states due to link failures/recovery.

Orchestra - Bot Automation
MERN, Electron, Sockets, IBM COS, Microservices
• Created a microservice-based workflow scheduler that executes tasks based on dates and conditional predicates, enabling automated and flexible orchestration of processes.
• Built an integrated Bot Store within the application, allowing users to browse and download bots contributed by open-source developers, fostering community-driven extensibility
• Problem solved the execution integrity in case of system crash while executing bot scripts, ensuring consistent state and quick recovery using a high level of journaling.

OPEN SOURCE CONTRIBUTION

Apache Superset (Ongoing) Pull Request-36301
React, Typescript, dnd-kit, react-dnd
• Migrate react-dnd react-based components to dnd-kit due to deprecation of react-dnd and improved performance of drag and drop in dnd-kit.
